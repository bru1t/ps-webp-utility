# WebP Utility

A set of utilities for quick and easy installation, configuration and further use of the `WebP` image format tools.

## What's here?

### `PS_WebP_Installer` *(Necessary for work)*

To install `WebP` on your device, simply run the file `PS_WebP_Installer` in `PowerShell`.

`Right-click` -> `Run with PowerShell`.

The installer will download the latest version of the libraries to work with `WebP`, install the necessary materials and embed the path to them in `Environment Variables`.

### `PS_All_Images_To_WebP`

If you just need to convert `JPG`/`PNG` into `WebP` you can run the file `PS_All_Images_To_WebP` which, by default, converts `JPG`/`PNG` images lying with him in the same folder to `WebP`.

## Settings

Each of the utilities has a block of available settings at the beginning with the necessary explanations of the functionality. 

To change the settings, do the following:

`Right-click` -> `Open with` -> `*Select any text editor that suits you*`.

After that you can see/change the settings of the utilities.
